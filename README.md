The website must have a header and footer on the page that does not change as the user navigates from page to page. The footer will include copyright information, a contact us email, rss subscribe feed, twitter and facebook icons. (no actual links required.)

Any and all content should be fictional, but not lorem ipsum.

Besides jQuery, no external libraries are allowed (no Bootstrap or Foundation et cetera). Evaluation sheets must also be submitted.
